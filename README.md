# two-triangles

This is a simple template inspired by [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and the presentation [Rendering Worlds with Two Triangles with raytracing on the GPU](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/material/nvscene2008/rwwtt.pdf) by [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/). I wanted a similar setup that I could use and deploy to my own website easily. My workflow is usually:

1. Copy the files
2. Run [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/) in the directory
3. Make edits to `fragment.glsl`

This is far from a perfect solution but can be dropped into any static server and just work.
